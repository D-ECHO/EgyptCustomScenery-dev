## Egypt Custom Scenery by Benedikt Wolf (D-ECHO)

This repository includes the scripts and data that was used for generating the "Egypt Custom Scenery". data/SRTM-1 and the work*/ folders are not included for file size reasons, but they can be generated using the scripts given here.

Following sources have been used:

* SRTM-1 global elevation data from https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/ 
* Landcover Data from AFRICOVER by the FAO from http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home?uuid=a7fd1a64-475f-4e34-a3b3-c79e014311ec 
	# This project uses landcover shapefiles produced by FAO - Africover
* Landcover Data from http://download.geofabrik.de and https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/land-polygons.html under ODbL 1.0
* Airport Data from https://gateway.x-plane.com and partially manually edited by Benedikt Wolf
* Objects from FlightGear's terrasync (see scenery.flightgear.org)

Thanks to _laserman_ for scripts to process airport data files into groundnets (https://github.com/mherweg/d-laser-fgtools)!
